# Advent of Code 2023
### These are my attempts at the problems from [AoC2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).
I will probably try to practice C programming. :)

### Copy the Makefile into the directory of the problem you want to run:
`$ make run F=file_name.c`
$ make runa F=file_name.c A="arg1 arg2"

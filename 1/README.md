# Advent of Code 2023 | Day 1 - Trebuchet
### This is my solution for [AoC2023 - Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1).

### Instructions:
1. Copy the `Makefile` from the project root into this directory.
	- `$ cp ../Makefile .`
2. `$ make run F=trebuchet.c`
	- Create your own input file and modify `IN_FILE_NAME` at the top of `trebuchet.c`.
